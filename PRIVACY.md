Privacy Policy

Effective Date: March 4, 2025

1. Introduction
Welcome to VaultSync ("we," "our," or "us"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use our Dropbox integration application ("the App").

2. Information We Collect
VaultSync does not collect any personal information. However, we access your Dropbox account as permitted by you to sync files between Obsidian and Dropbox.

3. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect to:

Provide, maintain, and improve the App’s functionality.

Authenticate your access to Dropbox and manage file interactions.

Ensure security and prevent fraudulent activities.

4. Data Access and Permissions
VaultSync requires the following Dropbox permissions:

account_info.read – To retrieve basic account information.

files.metadata.write – To update file metadata in Dropbox.

files.metadata.read – To read file metadata from Dropbox.

files.content.write – To write files to Dropbox.

files.content.read – To read files from Dropbox.

The application reads files from Dropbox to pull them into the Obsidian note-taking app and sync files between both platforms.

5. Data Storage
VaultSync does not store any user data on external servers. All data is stored either in the user's Dropbox account or on the user's device.

6. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell or rent your personal information. However, we may share your data in the following situations:

With Dropbox: To facilitate file access and storage as per your authorization.

Legal Compliance: If required by law or to protect our rights and users.

7. Data Security
We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, no online service is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

8. User Control and Data Retention
Users can revoke VaultSync’s access to Dropbox at any time through the plugin settings with a single click. Since we do not store any user data, there is no retention policy beyond what is managed by Dropbox and the user’s device.

9. Third-Party Links and Services
VaultSync does not use any third-party services. The App may contain links to third-party websites, but we are not responsible for their privacy practices and encourage you to review their policies.

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by posting the updated policy within the App or via email.
